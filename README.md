# Body-Performance-Webapp
This wix web site with python web app allows you to predict body performance based on several input parameters. It is built using Python and the Flask web framework.
# Getting started
## To use this web app, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the app.py script and update the path to the pickle file that contains the trained model.The path should be set to the location where you have saved the pickle file on your machine.
3. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
4. Open a terminal and run the app using the command "python app.py"(also if you haven't got the libraries needed you have to install them also).
5. Once the app is running, open your web browser and go to the following URL to directly open the predict page URL : http://localhost:5000/
6. Otherwise to go to the full website with the model go to the following wix site. (this is the website which includes demonstration videos and stuff adn before clicking the test now button make sure to run the app in your local host) URL : https://manulpasi123.wixsite.com/body-performance
7. You should now be able to use the web app to predict body performance based on the input parameters
   
# Output
The output of the web app is the predicted body performance of the person, which is rated from A (highest performance) to D (lowest performance). Also you can see the probabilities of each class.

# Thank you!!
# Hope you enjoy the app.
